## Project Title:
Web Scraping Application using Node.js, Puppeteer & Docker

## Description:
This project is a simple web scraping application developed using Node.js and Puppeteer.
The application opens a website automatically, extracts basic information such as the page
title and heading, and stores the scraped data in a JSON file.
Docker is used to containerize the application for easy deployment.

## How the Project Works
1. Puppeteer launches a headless browser.
2. The browser navigates to the given website.
3. The page title and heading are extracted.
4. The extracted data is saved into a JSON file.
5. Docker runs the application inside a container.
